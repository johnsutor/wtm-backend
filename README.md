# WTM Backend

This repository contains the code for the back end
of the What's The Move app. Powered by PyTorch and
Flask's API service, the WTM backend provides an
efficient means of reccomending restaurants based
on the principles of Q Learning. Taking in the user's
input each time they go out, What's The Move finds
the optimal experiences for each user based on
their preferred venues from the past.
